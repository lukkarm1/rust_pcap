<!--toc:end-->

Super simple pcap library to practice. Using minimal amount of crates because the goal is to learn, and not to make actual real-life library. Parser crate like 'nom' could be used to simplify and improve parsing for real-life use cases.


TODO:
 - [ ] Fix reading to handle unexpectedEOF correctly
 - [ ] Fix byte order handling
 - [ ] Fix crate structure (should be library, not binary)
 - [ ] Iterator for packets (If custom is needed)
